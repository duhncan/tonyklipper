# Tony Klipper
This repository contains all the upgrades and changes I have made to my original rose gold Tevo Tornado which I have named "Tony". I have previously come from an up to date version of Marlin 2.0.x though have now converted to klipper and will keep updating my configurations to this repo for safe keeping. Below you will find some details of my printer so that anyone else may pinch whatever they need to get their similar systems running.

## Configuration
The specs of the printer are as follows:
- Mainboard: Bigtreetech SKR 1.3
- Stepper Drivers:
  * X & Y : Bigtreetech TMC2130
  * Z : Bigtreetech TMC2208
  * E0 : LV8729
- Trianglelabs BMG Clone
- Trianglelabs Direct Drive E3D Clone
- Trianglelabs 3D Touch Clone
- Jaycar SSR Relay (Aussie Brand)

Most of these parts have been sourced from AliExpress.

## 3D Printed Parts
- I have converted this printer into an all-in-one (AIO) system with all the electronics mounted to the bottom of the frame.
- I have also designed a new hotend mount 
- __All of these parts can be found in the models section of this repo.__
